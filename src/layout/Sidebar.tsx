/**
 * Main navigation, drawn by the library's `Sidebar`.
 *
 * The library owns the tree: one recursive `items` model, one authoritative
 * `activeKey` (ancestors are derived, never passed in) and one expansion
 * state. What it deliberately does not own is routing — which entry matches
 * the current URL, and how to reach it without reloading the application —
 * so `activeKey` is computed here and `renderLink` hands the library the
 * router's own `Link`.
 *
 * Entries carry a real `href` rather than an `onClick` that navigates. That is
 * the difference between a link and a button to everything outside React:
 * ctrl-click, middle-click, "open in new tab" and the browser's status bar all
 * work again, and the library only calls `preventDefault()` for a disabled
 * item.
 *
 * Which entries exist at all is still the modules' answer
 * (`src/modules/registry.ts`), filtered by permission: the menu never promises
 * a screen the API will refuse.
